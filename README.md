# Sleep Disorder Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

## Description of the Project

This projects uses a Supervised Machine Learning algorithm (Random Forest) to predict and identify sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and insomnia. It uses existing data and data analysis techniques to categorize sleep-related metrics.

## Key Features of this Project

- Automated prediction of sleep disorders based on lifestyle factors
- Uses comprehensive sleep data, lifestyle factors and cardiovascular health indicators
- Enhances and validates existing sleep disorder prediction measures through AI measures

## AI Utilization in this Project

1. Data Analysis and Pattern Recognition: The Random Forest algorithm analyzes diverse data to uncover hidden patterns and correlations between different factors influencing sleep disorders 
2. Model Training: The Supervised Machine Learning predicts the likelihood of sleep disorder based on input data
3. Model Evaluation and Optimization: Use of sci-kit learn and TensorFlow library to optimize the model

## Supervised Machine Learning
