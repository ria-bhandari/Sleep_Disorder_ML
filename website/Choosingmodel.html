        <h2 class = "cnh2"> The model you choose to display your data is important to showcase accuracy and efficiency of the project</h2>
        <h2 class = "cnh2"> Here we chose the Random Forest Algorithm </h2>
        <h2 class = "cnh2"> The random forest algorithms have three main hyperparameters, these include node size, the number of trees, and the number of features sampled. From there, the random forest classifier can be used to solve regression or classification problems. We used Scikit learns existing function to find the most adequate hyperparameters for our models </h2>
        <h1 class = "cnh1"> "What are the benefits of Random Forest?"</h1>
        <h2 class = "cnh2"> 1. Reduced risk of overfitting: Decision trees run the risk of overfitting as they tend to tightly fit all the samples within training data. However, when there’s a robust number of decision trees in a random forest, the classifier won’t overfit the model since the averaging of uncorrelated trees lowers the overall variance and prediction error.        </h2>
        <h2 class = "cnh2"> 2. Provides flexibility: Since random forest can handle both regression and classification tasks with a high degree of accuracy, it is a popular method among data scientists. Feature bagging also makes the random forest classifier an effective tool for estimating missing values as it maintains accuracy when a portion of the data is missing.</h2>
        <h2 class = "cnh2"> 3. With this algorithm it is easy to determine feature importance</h2>
